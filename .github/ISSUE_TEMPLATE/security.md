## ðŸ‘® [Responsible Disclosure](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/processes/responsible_disclosure_template.md)

Do not open issues that might have security implications. It is critical that security related issues
are reported privately so we have time to address them before they become public knowledge.

Vulnerabilities can also be reported by emailing security@hospitalrun.io
